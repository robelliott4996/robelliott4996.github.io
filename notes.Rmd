The one fucking thing that I couldn't find mentioned directly.

When using rmarkdown to make websites with github, you need to Build the website in RStudio and upload those files too.

Things to add to this website include: book recommendations, a CV page, pictures of rocks.

Note to self: files are hosted on github. My local working directory is in my OneDrive in my R related folder. Might be beneficial to change that at some point to main Onedrive folder.
