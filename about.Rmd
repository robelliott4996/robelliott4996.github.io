Created by Robert Elliott initially for an R class in Fall of 2021.

I'm a second year Masters student at the University of New England. My project is a combination of bioinformatics and wetlab biochemistry to identify the protein target of an integral membrane protein called Palmitoyl Acyltransferase 14, or pat14 for short.
