Just a neurotypical, 25 year old New Englander that enjoys Strategy games, Sci-fi, stouts and sour beers, snowboarding, and climbing. I like to consider myself a *Scientist*, amateur mathematician, and astronomer. There's a fair amount of flannel. 

Basically indistinguishable from every other male presenting New England minimalist millennial/gen z.
