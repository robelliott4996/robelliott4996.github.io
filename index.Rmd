Hello, World.
This will serve as a repository of interesting media I've collected, CV's, resumes, possibly even a blog or two.

Note to self: files are hosted on github. My local working directory is in my OneDrive in my R related folder. Might be beneficial to change that at some point to main Onedrive folder.
